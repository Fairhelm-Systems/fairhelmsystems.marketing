/**
 * /llms.txt — the company's machine-readable surface.
 *
 * Rendered by src/app/llms.txt/route.ts at build time from the canonical
 * facts in lib/site-config.ts, so it states exactly what the pages, the
 * JSON-LD and the footer state. It is navigational and factual: a short
 * orientation, then links with useful descriptions to the canonical pages.
 * It is deliberately small, far smaller than SquareCampus's own llms.txt,
 * contains no instructions to assistants, publishes no metrics, and
 * duplicates nothing that the linked pages state better.
 *
 * Structure follows the llms.txt convention: H1, a blockquote summary,
 * orientation bullets, then H2 sections of `- [title](url): description`.
 * Pages with a Markdown alternate are linked to it; everything else links to
 * the HTML page. tests/llms.test.ts checks the structure and that every
 * link resolves to a public route.
